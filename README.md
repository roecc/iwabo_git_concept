All files should be named according to convention. We use the following abbreviations.

sideY - sideview Y direction
floor - topview Z direction

t1 - titan one
  cd - control dome

We use the convention to quickly find / identify any document, avoid mistakes and misunderstandings.

Since this convention is being built from scratch, please feel invited to contribute or suggest changes.
